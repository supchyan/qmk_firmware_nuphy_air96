# What Ive implemented?
I added `key_down` event handler into side_light air96 firmware, so now u can make cool animations for that sticks at corners of the keyboard.<br/>
As for an example, I added new lighting mode in side_light configuration, so u can check this out, by build my firmware! Just flash `.bin` file from `.build` directory. `.build.backup` is folder with original firmware, so if you want to restore changes, you can flash that `.bin` as well!<br/><br/>

```json
THIS IS FIRMWARE'S BUILD IS ONLY FOR NUPHY AIR96 KEYBOARD!
```
