# üê≥What I've implemented?
I added `key_down` event handler into sidelights of air96's firmware, so now you can make cool animations for that sticks at corners of the keyboard, when you typing something.<br/>
Also I made separated sidelights logic, so you can call it independently of each other. As for an example, I added `taiko mode` into sidelights animation presets. Try this too. (it's hardcoded to `S` `D` `K` `L` key events)<br/><br/>

You can try my firmware, by flashing it from `build.7z`<br/>
If you're disappointed my firmware, u can restore the original one, by flashing it from `build.backup.7z`.<br/><br/>

*p.s. I didn't add `VIA` support for sidelights, so it's only swappable with keyboard hotkeys, such as any sidelights animation presets*

```json
THIS FIRMWARE'S BUILD IS ONLY FOR NUPHY AIR96 KEYBOARD! DON'T TRY TO FLASH IT, UNTIL YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!
```
