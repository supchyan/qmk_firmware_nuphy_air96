# What Ive implemented?
I added `key_down` event handler into sidelights of air96's firmware, so now u can make cool animations for that sticks at corners of the keyboard.<br/><br/>

You can try my firmware, by installing it from `build.7z`<br/>
If you're disappointed my firmware, u can restore the original one, by installing it from `build.backup.7z`.<br/><br/>

p.s. I didn't implement VIA support for sidelights, so its only swappable with keyboard hotkeys. 

```json
THIS FIRMWARE'S BUILD IS ONLY FOR NUPHY AIR96 KEYBOARD! DON'T TRY TO FLASH IT, UNTIL YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!
```
